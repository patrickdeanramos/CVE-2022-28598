#ERPNext - 12.29.0

Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "last_known_version" field found in the "My Setting" page in ERPNext 12.29.0 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted site name by doing an authenticated POST HTTP request to '/desk#Form/User/(Authenticated User)' and inject the script in the 'last_known_version' field where we are able to view the script by clicking the 'pdf' view form.

This vulnerability is specifically the "last_known_version" field found under the 'My Settings' where we need to first save the my settings.

Under the ‘last_known_version’ field we are going to inject our malicious script.
